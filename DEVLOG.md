# 🛠️ Project Devlog [devduong Portfolio]

A personal portfolio site built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, deployed on **GitHub Pages**.

This project was created as both a learning exercise and a professional showcase to gain hands-on  
experience with building, structuring, and deploying a React.js application, and to serve as a  
dedicated space to present my work, projects, and development journey.

## 📌 About This Devlog

This devlog documents the development journey of my personal portfolio website.  
It serves as a record of progress, challenges, and key decisions made throughout the project.  
Along the way, I’ve noted what I’ve learned, what broke (and got fixed), and how the site evolved.

### 🎯 The goal:

To build a solid foundation in React and Tailwind, and to create a polished site that  
represents my skills and growth as a developer.

### 🥅 Development Goals:

- Add admin page for personal use:
  - `dev-duong.github.io/admin`
    - Includes a button linking to an editable CV page (`/admin/edit-cv`)
      - Save resume data locally (e.g., with `localStorage`)
      - Automatically update a public resume page (`/cv`) with the latest edited content
      - Public CV page includes a **Download as PDF** button for exporting the resume
    - Includes a button for other personal uses
